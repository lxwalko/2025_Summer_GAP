# LVC MathPhys Research Code
### An attempt at organization

Much of the code is disorganized and undocumented, this GitHub repo is the beginning of an  
attempt to rectify that.  

### How to use

*Assuming you have GAP downloaded, installed, and working.*  
    *To do so, visit* https://www.gap-system.org/    
    
1. Start GAP from the terminal with the command `gap`
2. Change directory to where this code is saved with the command `ChangeDirectoryCurrent( "filepath" );`
3. Read all the code in this codebase using the command `Read( "load.gap" );`  *Or you can read individual files with* `Read( "filename" );`
  
Documentation (where applicable) is written in the source files. More organized documentation can be found in the DOC.md file -- if and when I get to it.
